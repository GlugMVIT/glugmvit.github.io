# The morning of 6th October '19

The event kicked off at 10:00 am in the beautiful workspace of CoffeeBeans, HSR Layout. The place bustled with lots of college students and professionals. Everyone was brimming with enthusiasm and were ready to dive into open source. 

There were mentors and guides from Mozilla community assisting the participants throughout the event. From newbies to experts, everyone learned and explored new ideas. There were tech talks given by students. There were discussions on open source, Mozilla's open design and DeepSpeech. 

Overall, it was an interesting event. As much as people learned, they also enjoyed brainstorming ideas over tea and pizza. 

## Am I eligible to be a part of the Hacktoberfest?

Yes, you are! In fact anyone can contribute to open source. It's all about celebrating open source and giving it back. It does not have to be a code, it could even be a documentation or a little spelling fix.

## How long will Hacktoberfest go?

The entire October of 2019! You can contribute any time in this month. All you need to do is create four pull requests in order to win a cool T-shirt.
