## Let's learn Machine Learning together!
A two day workshop in collaboration with Google Devs India and GLUG MVIT for beginner and intermediate developers.
The goal of this event is to make people get stared with **Machine Learning** development.

Explore Machine Learning is a campaign designed for University students across India, APAC and EMEA to help them get started with basic concepts in machine learning and implementation of TensorFlow and eventually walk towards advanced concepts of machine learning. It is complemented with a couple of playground exercises and hands-on activities that can help boost confidence about the skills learnt in the curriculum.

We believe these skills can help you plan your career field of interests well in advance and support you to nurture your ideas into reality to build some amazing products with the help of
AI/ML.
