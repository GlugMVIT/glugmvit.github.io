We are a community of enthusiastic developers and contibutors towards open source software. The idea behind the foundation of the club was to support, promote and contribute towards free software. It started off in the year 2016 with just about 10 student members and volunteers, backed by the support from our then HOD Prof. Dilip Sen and the staff of Sir M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology, Bangalore. Free Software Movement Karnataka (FSMK), a non-profitable organisation working for spreading free software, has been an amazing motivator for the club. We have come a long way since its foundation and the response has been overwhelming. We have also partnered with the Microsoft Student Partners and Mozilla Reps communities to organise both offline and online events to take the technical community in the campus forward.

We believe that technology can solve problems by making it more available and accessible to people. Our main aim is to spread the relevance of free software and open source contribution, which has become a learning platform where we can share our knowledge with each other. We also organize workshops and seminars, and host hackathons where new ideas take shape.  

We are all dreamers and encourage new and creative ideas. Join us [here](https://t.me/codeshack). For any queries, feedback or suggestions, feel free to [chat](https://gitter.im/glugmvit/community), or send a [mail](mailto:glugmvit@gmail.com).
